# Livestream Captions

NOTE: This tutorial is for users wishing to integrate Shabad OS captions with their live stream software. This tutorial shows how to add a browser to popular live streaming applications.

## Concept

Shabad OS provides a url which displays parts of the currently activated line. To show this on a livestream, one has to add a browser element to the livestream program/software and point it to the aforementioned url. For more information on setting up the overlay, please see link:../overlay-basics/overlay-basics.adoc[overlay-basics]. This tutorial will show you how to integrate the overlay url with your livestream software.

## Practical

### Step 1: Find the Overlay URL for Shabad OS

### Step 2: Configure the Livestream Software

The most popular applications we've encountered with customers are OBS Studio and vMix, though any software which allows you to add a browser with a url will work.

TIP: Modifying browser size or ratio will result in blurry, non-crisp text. Zooming or resizing the browser in your livestream software will degrade the quality. Always make changes to the overlay through Shabad OS when possible for the best appearance.

#### OBS Studio

Add a browser to your OBS Studio scene by clicking the "+" button in _Sources_. For ease of use we recommend naming this source "Shabad OS Captions" instead of simply "Browser". Focus on the URL, Width, Height, and Custom CSS fields. The URL from Step 1 should be used. Width and Height should match the Base Canvas Resolution found in _Settings > Video_ (e.g. 1920x1080 would mean 1920 for the width and 1080 for the height). Clear the contents of Custom CSS.

#### vMix

Add a web browser input to your vMix mixer by clicking _Add Input > More > Web Browser_. Focus on the URL, Width, and Height fields. The URL from Step 1 should be used. Width and Height should match the Output Size found in _Settings > Display_ (e.g. 1920x1080 would mean 1920 for the width and 1080 for the height).
