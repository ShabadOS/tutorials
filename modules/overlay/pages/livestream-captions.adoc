# Livestream Captions

NOTE: This tutorial is for users wishing to integrate Shabad OS captions with their live stream software. This tutorial shows how to add a browser to popular live streaming applications.

## Concept

Shabad OS provides a url which displays parts of the currently activated line. To show this on a livestream, one has to add a browser element to the livestream program/software and point it to the aforementioned url. For more information on setting up the overlay, please see link:overlay-basics:overlay-basics.adoc[overlay-basics]. This tutorial will show you how to integrate the overlay url with your livestream software.

## Practical

### Step 1: Find the Overlay URL for Shabad OS

### Step 2: Configure the Livestream Software

The most popular applications we've encountered with customers are OBS Studio and vMix, though any software which allows you to add a browser with a url will work. Examples are shown below on how to more specifically add a browser/web page to your livestream software.

TIP: Modifying browser size or ratio will result in blurry, non-crisp text. Zooming or resizing the browser in your livestream software will degrade the quality. Always make changes to the overlay through Shabad OS when possible for the best appearance.

### OBS Studio

Add a browser to your OBS Studio scene by clicking the "+" button in _Sources_. For ease of use we recommend naming this source "Shabad OS Captions" instead of simply "Browser". Focus on the URL, Width, Height, and Custom CSS fields. The URL from Step 1 should be used. Width and Height should match the Base Canvas Resolution found in _Settings > Video_ (e.g. 1920x1080 would mean 1920 for the width and 1080 for the height). Clear the contents of Custom CSS.

### vMix

Add a web browser input to your vMix mixer by clicking _Add Input > More > Web Browser_. Focus on the URL, Width, and Height fields. The URL from Step 1 should be used. Width and Height should match the Output Size found in _Settings > Display_ (e.g. 1920x1080 would mean 1920 for the width and 1080 for the height).

### Wirecast Studio

From our experience Wirecast is both bloated and confusing for many users. If you are dead set on using wirecast and have already exhausted the above options, then you may do the following to integrate Shabad OS with your livestream.

. Add a web page shot layer to your Wirecast master layer. (You may ignore the prompt to install Flash becuase Shabad OS does not require it.)

. Set the name to something familiar (e.g. "Shabad OS Overlay").
. Focus on the Address, Video Width, and Video Height fields.
. The URL from Step 1 should be used for address (e.g. "http://localhost:1699/overlay").
. Width and Height should match the canvas size found in _Output > Canvas Size_ (e.g. "Auto (1280x720)" would mean 1280 for the width and 720 for the height).

.Configuring the Source Properties in Wirecast

. Lastly make sure that the scale of shot layer is set to 100%.
