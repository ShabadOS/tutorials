# Livestream Captions

NOTE: This tutorial is for users wishing to integrate Shabad OS captions with their live stream software. This tutorial shows how to add a browser to popular live streaming applications.

:toc:

## Concept

Shabad OS provides an Overlay URL which displays parts of the currently activated line. To show this on a livestream, one has to add a browser element to the livestream program/software and point it to the aforementioned URL. For more information on setting up the Overlay, please see how to xref:overlay:get-started-with-overlays.adoc[Get started with Overlays]. This tutorial will show how to integrate the Shabad OS Overlay with popular livestream softwares.

## Practical

### Step 1: Find the Overlay URL for Shabad OS

Copying this should be as easy as clicking the Overlay URL in _Shabad OS > Settings > Overlay_. If there is no URL there, please read xref:url-endpoints:url-endpoints.adoc[URL Endpoints].

### Step 2: Configure the Livestream Software

Add a browser, point it to the Overlay URL, and size it to match the live stream resolution.

TIP: For clear and crisp fonts, match the browser size to the resolution of the live stream. Avoid zooming or resizing the browser element to incorrect proportions.

NOTE: Any software which allows adding a browser URL will work. Popular applications like https://obsproject.com/[OBS Studio], https://www.vmix.com/[vMix], and https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm[Wirecast] can work. See <<Examples>> below.

## Examples

[NOTE]
.List of Examples
====
* <<OBS Studio>>
* <<vMix>>
* <<Wirecast>>
====

### OBS Studio

. Add a browser to OBS Studio's scene by clicking the "+" button in _Sources_. For ease of use we recommend naming this source "Shabad OS Captions" instead of simply "Browser".
. Focus on the _URL_, _Width_, _Height_, and _Custom CSS_ fields.
.. _URL_ should be the URL from <<step_1_find_the_overlay_url_for_shabad_os,Step 1>>.
.. _Width_ and _Height_ should match the Base Canvas Resolution found in _Settings > Video_ (e.g. 1920x1080 would mean 1920 for the width and 1080 for the height).
.. _Custom CSS_ should be empty.

### vMix

. Add a web browser input to vMix's mixer by clicking _Add Input > More > Web Browser_.
. Focus on the _URL_, _Width_, and _Height_ fields.
.. _URL_ should be the URL from <<step_1_find_the_overlay_url_for_shabad_os,Step 1>>.
.. _Width_ and _Height_ should match the Output Size found in _Settings > Display_ (e.g. 1920x1080 would mean 1920 for the width and 1080 for the height).

### Wirecast

. Add a web page shot layer to Wirecast's master layer. There may be a prompt to install Flash, which can be ignored as Shabad OS does not require it.

. Set the name to something familiar (e.g. "Shabad OS Overlay").
. Focus on the _Address_, _Video Width_, and _Video Height_ fields.
.. _Address_ should be the URL from <<step_1_find_the_overlay_url_for_shabad_os,Step 1>>.
.. _Video Width_ and _Video Height_ should match the Canvas Size found in _Output > Canvas Size_ (e.g. "Auto (1280x720)" would mean 1280 for the width and 720 for the height).
