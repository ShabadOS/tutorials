# Overlay Tips

NOTE: This tutorial is for users that want to learn more about Overlays. This tutorial describes what an overlay is and how it can be used.

## Concept

An overlay is an alternate display/presentation page. It contains information relevant to the currently activated line.

This alternate view of the current line enables users to add live streaming captioning for their broadcasts. It can be used as a secondary projector view containing alternate secondary fields (So the first projector shows the Gurbani and English Translation + Transliteration and the second projector shows the Gurbani and Punjabi Translation). And as a third example it can be used as a screen reader for the elderly with extra large text and high contrast letters.

By far the most popular use case we've heard is to add Live Streaming Captioning.
