# URL Endpoints

NOTE: This tutorial is for users wishing to know about Shabad OS being accessed through a web browser. This tutorial will show which pages are available as well as how to find the correct address to use in most modern web browsers.

## Concept

Most of Shabad OS is actually a website with different URLs. The presenter/display, controller, overlay, and settings/configuration are all accessible by most modern web browsers. This lets users connect to Shabad OS from other devices like another laptop or smartphone. For example, it allows users to control projectors in a gurdwara with their smartphone. For another example, it allows users to use Shabad OS on one device and livestream the captions with a different computer.

## Practical

### Table of Endpoints

A breakdown of the terminology used for Shabad OS URLs tends to follow the pattern: http:// [IP ADDRESS] : [PORT] / [ENDPOINT]. In production, Shabad OS uses the port 1699 for stable and beta releases. For instance the base url (empty endpoint) could be http://localhost:1699/ and the overlay url (overlay endpoint) could be http://localhost:1699/overlay. Users can test these endpoints, on the same machine running Shabad OS, with a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

|/controller/search?controllerOnly=true
|A fullscreened controller in the search activity

### Example

For example, if the device running Shabad OS has an IP address of 192.168.0.128, then the url for the overlay endpoint would be "http://192.168.0.128:1699/overlay". This could be used in a browser by any device on the same network. For example, allowing you to use Shabad OS from one device and livestream software from a second device. (Again, if the livestream software and Shabad OS were both running on the same device, you could have simply used "http://localhost:1699/overlay" as the URL).
