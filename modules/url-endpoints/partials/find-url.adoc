The device running Shabad OS has an IP address. In production, Shabad OS is available from port 1699 of this IP address. This combination of IP address and port can be used in most web browsers.

If the same device is running Shabad OS, you may simply use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" for the IP address (i.e. with port: "http://localhost:1699/" or "http://127.0.0.1:1699/"). If this is the case, you do not need to find the device's IP address on the network.

Otherwise, if you'd like to connect through the same network to Shabad OS being used on a different device, you may find the IP address of that device from _Shabad OS > Settings > About_.

Alternately, if it is on Windows 10, you can use the _Task Manager_ (either right click the taskbar or use the hotkey ctrl+shift+esc) to find the IP address by going to the _Performance_ tab and selecting the Ethernet/Wi-Fi being used to connect to the network.

Alternately, if it is on macOS, you can use the _System Preferences > Network_ (found from the apple icon in the menubar) and selecting the Ethernet/Wi-Fi being used to connect to the network.

For example, if the device running Shabad OS has an IP address of 192.168.0.128, then the url for the overlay endpoint would be "http://192.168.0.128:1699/overlay". This could be used in a browser by any device on the same network. For example, allowing you to use Shabad OS from one device and livestream software from a second device. (Again, if the livestream software and Shabad OS were both running on the same device, you could have simply used "http://localhost:1699/overlay" as the URL).
