The device running Shabad OS has an IP address. In production, Shabad OS is available from port 1699 of this IP address. This combination of IP address and port can be used in most web browsers.

If the same device is running Shabad OS, you may simply use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" for the IP address (i.e. with port: "http://localhost:1699/" or "http://127.0.0.1:1699/"). If this is the case, you do not need to find the device's IP address on the network.

Otherwise, if you'd like to connect through the same network to Shabad OS being used on a different device, you may find the IP address of that device from _Shabad OS > Settings > About_ or _Shabad OS > Settings > Overlay_.
